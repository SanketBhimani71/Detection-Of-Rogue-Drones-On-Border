| Name of the Industry	                  | Border Security Force (BSF)                    |

| Problem Statement	                      | Decaying And Rusting Of Border Defence Infrastructure |
| Challenge description witd context      | Regular attempts are made on the border by sending low flying drones to get sensitive information/ movements in the border area. As the fly path of these drones is low to be detected by radars, so detecting these rogue drones during the night becomes difficult by naked eyes. So, on ground troops face problems in locating & tracking to take further neutralization action. |
| Users                                   | Soldiers |
| Expected Outcomes                       | A system, which could detect these rogue drones with their height & distance within the range limit of 1 km and disrupt its mission by jamming. So that the border deployed Jawans could detect these flying objects/ drones easily and track to neutralize/ destroy it by above jamming/ manual firing on that. |
| Potential Impact                        | Monitoring and Patrolling  |
